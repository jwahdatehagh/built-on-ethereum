!(built on eth)[./built-on-eth.svg]

# ethereum-brand

this design plays with modularity, structure, and legibility, reinforcing ethereum’s core themes:

modular composition – the grid, boxes, and measured spacing hint at smart contracts as composable building blocks, mirroring how ethereum applications are stacked and interconnected.

type as code – the stencil-like typography evokes machine-readability, reminiscent of terminal interfaces, block explorers, or even physical engineering schematics. it reinforces ethereum as an infrastructure layer, not just a brand.

ethereum as foundation – "built on" is enclosed in distinct, separate modules, while "ethereum" spans across both, visually acting as the base layer—a structural metaphor for how ethereum underpins decentralized applications.

identity through constraint – the stylized "E" in "ethereum" (with missing horizontal bars) creates a recognizable typographic signature, subtly signaling cryptographic abstraction, minimalism, and code aesthetics.

tl;dr: it’s not just saying "built on ethereum"—it’s showing it through construction, composition, and coded visual language.
